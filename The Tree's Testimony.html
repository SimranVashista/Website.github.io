<p class="om"> Once the emperor Akbar was roaming around his garden with his ideator and Birbal ,then  he saw that some crows were making loud raspy cow and kraa ,then suddenly he asked the question among ideators. He said:<br>
<br>
<b>Akbar</b>: Will any body tell me the number of crows in our kingdom??
<br>
<br>
Nobody Answered.
<br>
<br>
Then suddenly Akbar faced towards Birbal and said:
<br>
<br>
<b>Akbar</b>: Would you like to answer my question Birbal ??
<br>
<br>
<b>Birbal</b>:Yes , my lord i would love to ,but i want some time.
<br>
<br>
<b>Akbar</b>:Yes, you are provided.  
<br>
<br>
Everybody leaved
<br>
<br>
Now At Birbal mahal ,Birbal was roaming around his garden and all of a sudden he noticed that a old ,thin structured man coming towards him ,<br><br>
<b>Old man</b>:Adaab huzoor! My name is Nakiram and i am a very old farmer and i need your help without it i will get ruined ,Please help me :He cried <br>

<b>Birbal</b>:Don't panic! tell me your problem ,I will definitely help you out(He condolenced him).<br>
<br><b>Nakiram</b>: Huzoor! I every year used to hide my earnings underneath of a tree .Three months ago,I wished and decided to go to a pilgrimage and thus want my earnings to be secured  to some trustful hands.Thus ,I went to my old best friend    kishorilal .
<br><br>
He was very rich and living a lavish lifestyle  , so I went there and asked him :-

<br>
<br><b>Kishorilal</b>:Hello! Nakiram,Yes tell me what brings you here .
<br>
<br>
<b>Nakiram</b>: I was going to pilgrimage and want my savings to be in trustful hands ,so i decided to  give you as you are my best friend ,When i will return i will take it back .
<br><br>
<b>Kishorilal</b>: Sure Nakiram! I accept it and definitely return it you back .
<br><br>Now Nakiram continue to tell his problem to Birbal .
<br><br>
<b>Nakiram</b>:Then I went to pilgrimage and day before yesterday I returned and decided to go to Kishorilal
  tomorrow.
<br> 
<br>
 Nakiram went to Kishorilal House .
<br><br><b>Nakiram</b>:Hello ! Kishorilal.
<br>
<br><b>Kishorilal</b>:Hello! Nakiram,How was your pilgrimage??
<br><br><b>Nakiram</b>:Fine ! and I brought prasad for you from there.

<br>
<b>Nakiram</b>:Please ! Kishorilal do not do this to me ,I am very poor.
<br><br><b>Kishorilal</b>:Go Away ! from here you lier!!
