Once Emperor Akbar with his courtiers sitting on his garden's hall listening to the raag sung by tansen.(Raag was over)
Everybody appreciating  tansen for his melodious voice and lovely raag:<br><br>
<b>Akbar</b>: Lovely! Tansen I have to say you are a great artist ,no one is like you ,you are number one in my kingdom.
<br><br><b>Courtiers</b>: Ji Huzoor! No one can beat the way tansen sings.
<br><br><b>Tansen</b>:It's your goodness majesty there are more talented artist in this kingdom.
<br><br><b>Akbar</b>:No,Tansen it's your kindness. 
<br><br>Everybody appreciates and nodding of what Akbar was saying except Birbal he was not uttering a single word.
Everybody leaves...
<br><br>
Meanwhile walking to the courtroom Akbar said:
<br><br><b>Akbar</b>:What happened Birbal are you not agreeing what i said??
<br><br><b>Birbal</b>:Huzoor! As tansen himself said that there are more talented artist in this kingdom.His guru will be more talented than him . 
<br><br><b>Akbar</b>:Is that true tansen ??
<br><br><b>Tansen</b>:Ji Huzoor! Birbal is absolutely correct but my guru is gone to a pilgrimage yatra he will be back  in one month.
<br><br><b>Akbar</b>:Ok done ,we'll meet him after one month (meanwhile Akbar throws take out his ring from his finger and throws it into the well in front of him )  call him  Birbal after one month .And one more task is for you that take out this ring from the well without touching it and without using anything .
<br><br><b>Birbal</b> Ji Huzoor! 
<br><br><br><br> After One month ..............
<br><br><br>
<b>Akbar</b>:Birbal have you called the guru of tansen to darbar we want to listen his voice??
<br><br>
<b>Tansen</b>:My majesty! he lives in middle of jungle and never goes to anywhere ,so we have to go there to listen to his song.
<br><br>
<b>Akbar</b>:Ok we will go there.
<br><br><br>They Went.......
<br><br><br>(Near guru ji's hut )      
 <br><br><br><b>Akbar</b>:Let's move inside .
<br><br><b>Tansen</b>:My majesty he will not sing if we'll go inside he will not sing ,Please let us wait near this treee he will come out to sing then we'll get to listen his song .
<br><br><b>Akbar</b>:Ok ,we'll wait.
<br><br><br>After some time.........
<br><br>Guru ji came out of his hut with his sitaar  and starting singing.
<br><br>Everybody listening to his soothing voice..
<br><br<b>Akbar appreciates his voice and wanted to reward him but guru ji refused to take it .They leaved ...
<br><br>
Meanwhile he asked Tansen ..
<br><br>
<b>Akbar</b>:Tansen how he is a better singer than you .
<br><br>
<b>Tansen</b>:Huzoor! ....(he hesitates).
<br><br>
<b>Birbal</b>:Huzoor! I'll explain this.Huzoor! Tansen sings for us to get money whereas guru ji sings for god this can be achieved by sacrificing wealth and greed .
<br><br>
<b>Akbar</b>:Birbal i'm satisfied with your answer ,but what happened to my ring will i get it or not (he laughed). 
<br><br>
<b>Birbal</b>:Huzoor! ,we'll get it in the way.
<br><br>They stop in front of well..
<br><br><br>Birbal picked large dry dung floating on the water he broked and take out the ring.(Tansen and Akbar just looking at Birbal's face  astonishing).
<br><br><b>Akbar</b>:Explain it Birbal!!;
<br><br>
<b>Birbal </b>: Huzoor! one month ago when you throwed your ring ,into the well after you gone i throwed dung on that ring it got dried up in two to three days or so, then well got filled up with the rainwater when rain camed so i got your ring without touching it or without using any  means ,nature got it for you.
<br><br>
<b>Akbar</b>: Once again you prooved Birbal that you are brilliant,just brilliant.
